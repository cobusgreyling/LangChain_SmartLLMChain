We can account for this by assuming that the rate of digging scales with the number of people, but not necessarily linearly. We can introduce a modifier factor to reflect this.\\n\\nStep 3: The improved answer taking into account the modifier factor is as follows:\\n\\nLet's assume that the rate of digging scales with the number of people, but not linearly. Let's introduce a modifier factor of K to account for this.
